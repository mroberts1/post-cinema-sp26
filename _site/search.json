    "text": "W2: Fandom\n\nMaking great music and being great on stage no longer seem to be enough.\n\n—Nancy Baym\n\n\n Nancy K. Baym, “Social Media and the Struggle for Society” Nancy K. Baym, Daniel Cavicchi, and Norma Coates, “Music Fandom in the Digital Age: A Conversation”\nSee also: Lauren Mayberry, “Chvrches’ Lauren Mayberry: ‘I will not accept online misogyny’” (The Guardian, 30 September 2013. \nWhether it’s a band, a filmmaker, an influencer, a sports team, or a videogame, we are all fans of somebody or something now. Fandom today is a social obligation, an expected marker of normal socialization: to not to be a fan of anything is weird, an indicator of social alienation. But even the socially alienated—known in Japan as otaku (roughly, nerds) or in extreme cases, hikikomori (shut-ins, who never leave their room and spend all their waking lives immersed in online gameworlds) are fans, even superfans. It’s not always been this way, of course. Back in 1986, nerdy Star Trek fans were still being lampooned in SNL comedy skits. Even back then, though, nobody would have considered telling obsessive sports fans to “get a life”, because being a fan of an actual sports team was not considered as excessive. But Star Trek was “just” a TV show, whose legitimacy as an object of such excessive devotion was far less obvious, given the longstanding (and still persistent) perception of television as trivial entertainment. This also explains, by the way, why fandom only began to be taken seriously in academia as a legitimate object of study from the 1990s onwards, beginning with Henry Jenkins’s classic study of Star Trek fandom Textual Poachers in 1992, and soon after Constance Penley’s NASA/Trek Other areas of media fandom, particularly around Japanese anime, have taken much longer to establish their legitimacy. It can be seen from these examples that perceptions of fandom are intertwined with the status within the dominant culture of the media or platforms that are the object of the fandom in question (popular music, film, TV, videogames, anime, TikTok).Henry Jenkins, Textual Poachers: Television Fans and Participatory Culture (New York: Routledge, 1992). Constance Penley, NASA/Trek: Popular Science and Sex in America (New York: Verso, 1997).\nFast forward a few decades, and as you see from the discussion about music fandom between Nancy Baym, Daniel Cavicchi, and Norma Coates, fandom has become a large and well-established field within media studies and related fields (cultural studies, ethnography). No longer stigmatized as in the 1990s, the nerd has become a staple of mainstream entertainment, from Napoleon Dynamite to The Big Bang Theory and its spinoff, Young Sheldon. How, when, and particularly why this cultural shift happened is a larger set of questions that there isn’t space to adequately address here, but has also been the subject of much theorizing in the academic literature on fandom.\nSo much for the background; but let’s come back to the specific focus of the second article assigned for this week: music fandom and its changing modalities in the emergence of digital culture and social media since the 1990s. For reasons explained above, books such as Kaitlyn Tiffany’s first-person study of One Direction fans are today routine. It’s fine to publicly obsess over Harry Styles or other boy-band idols, while media scholars are devoting entire academic syllabi to Taylor Swift. Since fandom today has become such a vast field, then, I’ll limit myself to a couple of observations arising from the article on music fandom in the social media age that may provide some starting points for this week’s discussion.Kaitlyn Tiffany, Everything I Need I Get From You: How Fangirls Created the Internet as We Know It (New York: Farrar, Strauss & Giroux, 2022).\nThe first of these relates to the question of race in relation to fandom. On the last page of the discussion of music fandom, Nancy Baym observes:\n\nI think, for example, of black punks, and how they, like punk women (and, most of all, like black punk women), have already been written out of histories of punk. Fan scholarship has begun to talk about race, as phenomena like casting white actors to play Asian characters has become a topic that increasingly merits discussion beyond the purviews of fandoms themselves (151).\n\nWhile Baym’s point itself is valid enough, it’s significant that it’s is the only reference to race in this discussion of music fandom by these three white scholars. While (as is clear from the discussion) the relationship between fandom and gender identities has been a major focus of attention in academic discussions of fandom, from Beatlemania to One Direction, it’s also true that until relatively recently the field of fandom studies has been overwhelmingly dominated by studies of predominantly white fandoms by white scholars who have largely ignored racial and ethnic identities in relation to fandom. While there has been some diversification within the past decade or so, to my mind this remains very much the case even today. Where, say, black fandom has been discussed, it’s been primarily focused on hip hop and/or Afrofutursm, as if these cultural forms were co-extensive with black cultural identity. But this is far from being the case, as both the controversial but longstanding white fandom for hip hop or anime attest, as well as the even more longstanding black fandom for hardcore and punk music. For more on the latter, I recommend the excellent documentary Afro-Punk (dir. James Spooner, 2003). Other than such isolated studies, there remains considerable scope today for exploring the question of race in music fandom and in other fandoms beyond it.\n\nThe Bots, “Stop” (2010)\nThe second point is in relation to Daniel Cavicchi’s reference (p. 144) to the transcultural dimension of contemporary global fandom. While the most obvious contemporary example is the global fandom around K-pop, fandom was transcultural long before the viral success of “Gangnam Style”—consider for example the US fandom for Japanese anime since the 1970s, or conversely, the Japanese fandom for hip hop (not to mention countless other western musical styles and genres). Today, however, it’s undeniable that the global fandoms around K-pop and other elements of the “Korean Wave” are the best example that fandom has arguably always been transcultural.See Bertha Chin and Lori Hitchcock Morimoto, “Introduction: Fan and Fan Studies in Transcultural Context” in Participations: Journal of Audience and Reception Studies 12:2 (November 2015): 174-79.Roland Kelts, Japanamerica: How Japanese Pop Culture Has Invaded the U.S. (London: Palgrave Macmillan, 2006).Ian Condry, Hip-Hop Japan: Rap and the Paths of Cultural Globalization (Durham, N.C.: Duke University Press, 2006).\nLast spring (perhaps like some of you), I visited the “Hallyu! The Korean Wave” exhibition at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, which included an extensive section devoted to K-pop. Like the London exhibition that preceded it, the MFA exhibition was wildly successful, attracting large numbers of K-pop fans. Over the past decade, K-pop and the global fandoms swirling around it have been the subject of countless academic studies, and today it constitutes an academic subfield in its own right. At the time of writing, the K-pop rollercoaster shows no sign of slowing down: after three seasons of Netflix’s Squid Game, the runaway hit of the summer is a 3D animation movie that you might possibly have heard of called K-Pop Demon Hunters (2025). While the older transcultural fandoms for Japanese media products continue, they have long since been eclipsed by K-pop’s domination of transcultural pop fandom. What are we to make of all this? Why is it that K-pop seems to resonate with such culturally different audiences around the globe? These are questions that continue to be studied by transcultural fandom scholars today.The Boston exhibition originated in an exhibition in 2023 at the Victoria & Albert Museum in London.\nAcademic studies of fandom have for too long remained focused largely on national cultural contexts, from Star Wars to Dr. Who. In the age of global streaming and social media platforms, however, it’s clear that music fandom has been transforming almost before our eyes, as global K-pop is joined by a host of other hybridized musical styles spawned by local fandoms for internationally circulating styles, from psychedelia to punk to heavy metal to EDM. Perhaps the biological phenomenon of spawning, indeed, may provide the best metaphor today for the musical ecosystems swarming around the globe, and the fandoms that sustain them. In such an environment, there’s no knowing what may be the next thing to crawl out of the pond, but the next generation of Demon Hunters will surely be waiting for it.",

    "section": "Introduction",
    "text": "Introduction\nThe term social media is popularly understood as referring to corporate-owned, advertising-funded communication platforms based on user-generated content: YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Twitch, Discord, TikTok. It can also be defined more broadly, however, as a set of networked, technologically-mediated practices of communication, structured by economic and political forces that both inflect and are inflected by social and cultural identities. These platforms, the social practices that they enable, and the relationship between the two are the objects of social media theory. But what does it mean to theorize social media? Why do we need social media theory at all?\n\n\n\n\n\nTo theorize something involves a number of processes\n\n\n\nfirst, how do we define the phenomenon or object of study itself? How does it differ from previous or other related phenomena?\nhow are we to account for it? Why did it happen/is it happening now rather than at some other time? What are its conditions of possibility?\nwhat is its relation to larger areas of society? What are its implications for those areas?\nhow are we to evaluate it, in terms of its implications (political, economic, social, ethical, legal, environmental, aesthetic)? What are its possibilities and limits, its progressive and oppressive aspects? How can we change it for the better?\n\n\n\nThese processes involve developing analytical frameworks or models comprising concepts that are useful for identifying and analyzing key aspects of and issues raised by the phenomenon/object in question. These frameworks and concepts typically draw from existing ones in different fields of study, but often involve the proposal of new frameworks and concepts specific to the field in question."

    "text": "Policies\nLate Policy\nAssignments that are late will lose 1/2 of a grade per day, beginning at the end of class and including weekends and holidays. This means that a paper, which would have received an A if it was on time, will receive a B+ the next day, B- for two days late, and so on. Time management, preparation for our meetings, and timely submission of your work comprise a significant dimension of your professionalism. As such, your work must be completed by the beginning of class on the day it is due. If you have a serious problem that makes punctual submission impossible, you must discuss this matter with me before the due date so that we can make alternative arrangements. Because you are given plenty of time to complete your work, and major due dates are given to you well in advance, last minute problems should not preclude handing in assignments on time.\n\nMandatory Reporter\nFitchburg State University is committed to providing a safe learning environment for all students that is free of all forms of discrimination and harassment. Please be aware all FSU faculty members are “mandatory reporters,” which means that if you tell me about a situation involving sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, or stalking, I am legally required to share that information with the Title IX Coordinator. If you or someone you know has been impacted by sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating or domestic violence, or stalking, FSU has staff members trained to support you. If you or someone you know has been impacted by sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating or domestic violence, or stalking, please visit http://fitchburgstate.edu/titleix to access information about university support and resources.\n\nHealth\nHealth Services\nHours: Monday-Friday 8:30AM-5PM Location: Ground Level of Russell Towers (across from the entrance of Holmes Dining Hall) Phone: (978) 665-3643/3894\nCounseling Services\nThe Counseling Services Office offers a range of services including individual, couples and group counseling, crisis intervention, psychoeducational programming, outreach ALTERNATIVE ECOSYSTEMSs, and community referrals. Counseling services are confidential and are offered at no charge to all enrolled students. Staff at Counseling Services are also available for consultation to faculty, staff and students. Counseling Services is located in the Hammond, 3rd Floor, Room 317.\nFitchburg Anti-Violence Education (FAVE)\nFAVE collaborates with a number of community partners (e.g., YWCA Domestic Violence Services, Pathways for Change) to meet our training needs and to link survivors with community based resources. This site also features resources for help or information about dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking. If you or someone you know is in an abusive relationship or has been a victim of sexual assault, there are many places to go for help. Many can be accessed 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. On campus, free and confidential support is provided at both Counseling Services and Health Services.\nCommunity Food Pantry Food insecurity is a growing issue and it certainly can affect student learning. The ability to have access to nutritious food is incredibly vital. The Falcon Bazaar, located in Hammond G 15, is stocked with food, basic necessities, and can provide meal swipes to support all Fitchburg State students experiencing food insecurity for a day or a semester.\nThe university continues to partner with Our Father’s House to support student needs and access to food and services. All Fitchburg State University students are welcome at the Our Father’s House Community Food Pantry. This Pantry is located at the Faith Christian Church at 40 Boutelle St., Fitchburg, MA and is open from 5-7pm. Each “household” may shop for nutritious food once per month by presenting a valid FSU ID.\n\nAcademic Integrity\nThe University “Academic Integrity” policy can be found online at http:// www.fitchburgstate.edu/offices-services-directory/office-of-student-conductmediation-education/academic-integrity/. Students are expected to do their own work. Plagiarism and cheating are inexcusable. Any instance of plagiarism or cheating will automatically result in a zero on the assignment and may be reported the Office of Student and Academic Life at the discretion of the instructor.\nPlagiarism includes, but is not limited to: - Using papers or work from another class. - Using another student’s paper or work from any class. - Copying work or a paper from the Internet. - The egregious lack of citing sources or documenting research.\nIf you’re not clear on what is or is not plagiarism, ASK. The BEST case scenario if caught is a zero on that assignment, and ignorance of what does or does not count is not an excuse. That being said, I’m a strong supporter of Fair Use doctrine. Just attribute what you use–and, again, ASK if there’s any doubt.\nAmericans With Disabilities Act (ADA)\n\nIf you need course adaptations or accommodations because of a disability, if you have emergency medical information to share with the instructor, or if you need special arrangements in case the building must be evacuated, please inform the faculty member as soon as possible.\n\nTechnology\nAt some point during the semester you will likely have a problem with technology. Your laptop will crash; your iPad battery will die; a recording you make will disappear; you will accidentally delete a file; the wireless will go down at a crucial time. These, however, are inevitabilities of life, not emergences. Technology problems are not excuses for unfinished or late work. Bad things may happen, but you can protect yourself by doing the following:\n\nPlan ahead: A deadline is the last minute to turn in material.

    "title": "W6: From Subcultures to Aesthetics",
    "section": "",
    "text": "} \n\n\nW6: From Subcultures to Aesthetics\n\n\nReadings:\nGuilherme Giolo and Michaël Berghman, “The Aesthetics of the Self: The Meaning-Making of Internet Aesthetics” (PDF) Aesthetics Wiki (read all articles in the section called “What Are Aesthetics?” and explore the site)\nI’m assuming that you’re all very familiar with the notion of an aesthetic, but I’m also assuming that you’re not familiar with thinking about it from an analytical standpoint. But that’s exactly what we’re going to do this week, and what this week’s reading assignments are about. I think we can all agree that the term itself has become ubiquitous in contemporary youth culture, yet the concept itself remains surprisingly undiscussed or debated within that same culture; it’s as if all of us already know exactly what the term itself refers to, so discussions tend to circulate around specific aesthetics rather than on what the term itself is referring to. As media scholars, however, scrutinizing such supposedly transparent terms is precisely what we are required to do. In this week’s reading assignments and lecture, I hope that you’ll discover that the term “aesthetic” is a lot more pervasive, and a lot more complex than you may have realized. I would go so far as to argue that it’s one of the most important concepts of our time because it provides a framework within which we construct our very sense of identity. But in today’s youth culture, this process works very differently from how it has done until quite recently.\nTake a very well-known aesthetic like cyberpunk. If you take a look at the entry on the Aesthetics Wiki, you’ll discover (and you may know already) that the term “cyberpunk” originated in the literary sphere, specifically a subgenre of science fiction that originated in the early 1980s in the fiction of male Anglo-American novelists such as William Gibson and Bruce Sterling, while a variant of cyberpunk that subsequently devloped in the fiction of Neil Stephenson and others became known as steampunk, an equally well-known aesthetic today. The point here is that even though both cyberpunk and steampunk started out as popular subgenres of literary science fiction, they are today much more than just that. From its inception, in fact, cyberpunk was never an exclusively literary genre, and along with William Gibson’s novel Neuromancer (1984) Ridley Scott’s noirish, science fiction film Blade Runner (Ridley Scott, 1982) has become synonymous with the genre. After Gibson’s film and Scott’s film, cyberpunk’s distinctive aesthetic became ubiquitous not just in other works of fiction and movies but also videogames and graphic novels, and today extends across the whole spectrum of contemporary media: no longer just a literary style, it’s a visual style (reprised in the recent sequel Blade Runner 2049 (Denis Villeneuve, 2017)), a musical style (a derivative of the EDM genre synthwave), and a fashion style (cosplay); “Steampunk” is a popular Halloween outfit.\nDrawing on the older analytical framework of media semiotics, it’s of course interesting and fun to try to identify the the specific elements of the cyberpunk aesthetic. Of course, this isn’t limited to purely audiovisual elements and motifs—neon-drenched urban cityscapes at night, a heavily purple color palette, ambient electronic soundscapes inspired by the soundtrack of Blade Runner—but also characterization, plot structures, narrative themes, production design, costume design. Trying to define cyberpunk in this way quickly becomes a trickier task than it initially appears. Much the same argument could be made about other major aesthetics of our time, from goth to vaporwave. The point, though, is that even though aesthetics may originate in one particular medium, genre, or platform—literature, film, popular music, anime—they are no longer limited to any one of these but extend across them; this is, in fact, why they are more usefully defined as aesthetics. We’ve already seen a good example of this in the first week of classes, with the aesthetic of the Japanese Studio Ghibli, which as we have seen has its own distinctive aesthetic that has made it recognizable worldwide.\nYet it could also be suggested that as was the case with the historical cinematic genre known as film noir, cyberpunk, vaporwave, or Ghibli, their aesthetic is not just limited purely to their stylistic elements (visuals, music, etc.) or even their narratives or character design, but includes other elements that are a lot harder to define: a particular worldview, for example (nihilistic, humanistic, etc.); a particular sensibility or emotional register that can be expressed by two other key contemporary concepts: mood and vibe. Just as cyberpunk has its own particuar vibe, so too in a very dfferent way do Ghibli movies. What are the characteristics of this mood or vibe in either case, and what exactly do we mean by “vibe” in the first place? It’s another term that is worth thinking about. I won’t say any more about it here, but encourage you to reflect upon it in this week’s discussion forum.\nSo what, exactly, is an aesthetic? In what is to my knowledge the only academic source to date to have explored the concept of the aesthetic in theoretical terms, Giolo and Berghman (2024) suggest that traditional conceptual frameworks such as genre, lifestyle, or subculture are no longer adequate to understanding the contemporary modalities of cultural identity and creativity. Instead, they explore the concept of the “aesthetic” as the key component of a new analytical framework. What does an “aesthetic” in this contemporary sense consist of? One of the defining components of what Giolo and Berghman call Internet aesthetics is their association with certain kinds of experience, and the corresponding feelings evoked by the memory of that experience: the experience of living in the world of 1950s America, for example, or the world of Harry Potter; the experience of living in a dystopian future; or, one might add, the experience of living on the American West Coast in the 1970s, or in Tokyo at the height of the bubble economy. While music is a key component of such experiences, it is only one modality within a larger cultural world. Imaginatively speaking, aesthetics recall the fantasy worlds of videogames and LARPing:\n\nExperiences (and, likely, their importance for Internet aesthetics) seem to be even more evident in the titles of playlists associated with different aesthetics: “You are studying in a haunted library with ghosts” (dark academia playlist), “You found the entrance to a secret garden”, “You are falling for the protagonist in a fantasy novel” (light royaltycore), or “A playlist for old money living in the French countryside” (light academia). Even clearer here, multiple objects (songs) are grouped and given symbolic meaning under a new interpretive key. This key is experience-centered. Thus, it seems acceptable to assume that experience is also the goal of an Internet aesthetic: to become someone different, to feel as if living in a different time (2024). [Emphasis mine]\n\nGiolo and Berghman (2024) also emphasize the affective dimension of Internet aesthetics, and their interviewees frequently reference feelings when describing them:\n\n“The aesthetics that I like really depend on my mood of the day. On Sundays, when it’s sunny, I really enjoy aesthetic images that give me this summer feeling” Jane (Dutch, prefers “cottagecore”).\nJane, who strongly connects “cottagecore” to morning walks, went on to explain that in those moments the scenarios and imaginaries of this Internet aesthetic “flow” into her activity, representing “the things I would like at that moment. They give me a warming feeling” (2024). [Emphasis mine]\n\nBy now we are (hopefully) getting closer to understanding what it means to describe city pop as an aesthetic rather than just a musical genre. Like vaporwave, like future funk, like mallsoft, like lo-fi hip hop, city pop conjures up a particular kind of cultural-historical aesthetic experience and a corresponding affective structure, via playlists, imagery, and other elements. As has been much discussed in the case of vaporwave, the dominant temperamental register is nostalgic and melancholic, invoking a bygone era of economic optimism and technological utopianism rendered only more poignant by the harsh realities of the dystopian present.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nDenis Villeneuve, dir. 2017.

Broadly speaking, this can be defined as the diverse range of symbolic practices through which communities affirm and maintain their cultural identities using digital media devices and interfaces in a globally networked society. While these practices are structured by deeply unequal power relations, are contradictory, and often come into conflict with one another, collectively they constitute what may be considered a global digital culture.\nA key component of the course is the automation of various forms of creative production, from writing to the visual arts, by natural-language processing computational systems (generally referred to as “artificial intelligence” or “AI”). The course addresses some of the many issues raised by such systems, with a particular focus on questions of aesthetics and the increasingly contested relationship between artists and algorithms. While such systems now demonstrably pass the Turing Test (i.e. pass as human or their products as human-produced), they also compel us to reconsider what we mean by “art,” or “intelligence” itself.\n\n\n\nThis is primarily a critical-thinking course, although it includes a practical and production component. This means that it encourages you to think reflexively and analytically about the digitally-mediated cultural practices that the course considers, as well as to participate in them; for example, you will be invited to experiment with image-synthesis and text-generating software and analyze the results using key concepts and theoretical frameworks.\n\n\n\nBy the end of the course, students will:\n\nhave acquired a deeper understanding of the social, cultural, and political dimensions of digital technologies and networked communication;\nbe able to apply critical thinking to contemporary developments in digital culture using relevant analytical concepts and both qualitative and quantitative methodologies such as cultural analytics;\nunderstand basic principles of algorithmic image synthesis on a variety of platforms;\nhave reflected upon and discussed the larger significance of machine learning systems within global networked societies.\n\n\n\n\nSelected chapters from the texts below will be made available as PDFs; you are nevertheless encouraged to purchase at least several of texts that are of interest and read more of them.\nNote on formats: A number of texts listed in the Bibliography are available as e-books and/or audiobooks.

Issues of diversity may be a part of class discussion, assigned material, and projects. The instructor will make every effort to ensure that an inclusive environment exists for all students. If you have any concerns or suggestions for improving the classroom climate, please do not hesitate to speak with the course instructor or to contact the Social Justice Center at 617-824-8528 or by email at sjc@emerson.edu.\nDiscrimination, Harassment, or Sexual Violence\nIf you have been impacted by discrimination, harassment, or sexual violence, I am available to support you, and help direct you to available resources on and off campus. Additionally, the Office of Equal Opportunity (oeo@emerson.edu; 617-824-8999) is available to meet with you and discuss options to address concerns and to provide you with support resources. Please note that I because I am an Emerson employee, any information shared with me related to discrimination, harassment, or sexual violence will also be shared with the Office of Equal Opportunity.  If you would like to speak with someone confidentially, please contact the Healing & Advocacy Collective, the Emerson Wellness Center, or the Center for Spiritual Life.\nAccessibility\nEmerson is committed to providing equal access and support to all students who qualify through the provision of reasonable accommodations, so that each student may fully participate in the Emerson experience. If you have a disability that may require accommodations, please contact Student Accessibility Services (SAS) at SAS@emerson.edu or 617-824-8592 to make an appointment with an SAS staff member.\nStudents are encouraged to contact SAS early in the semester. Please be aware that accommodations are not applied retroactively.\nWriting & Academic Resource Center\nStudents are encouraged to visit and utilize the staff and resources of Emerson’s Writing Center, particularly if they are struggling with written assignments.
