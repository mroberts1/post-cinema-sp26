Are you "bookish"? As you'll have seen if you've read Jessica Maddox and Fiona Gill's article about Booktok, the term has become ubiquitous in the intersecting worlds of Booktube, Bookstagram, and Booktok, as well as social reading sites like [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/). I want to spend some time here reflecting on the concept of **bookishness** itself. What does it mean to be, or to become, "bookish"? While the term itself long predates social media, it's taken on a particular resonance in relation to the representation of books and the practice of reading on social media. In that context, to be "bookish" means to participate in what Maddox and Gill refer to as the "digital imagined community" of bibliophiles extending across the platforms of YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok. So what does being "bookish" actually mean in *that* specific context? What exactly is "bookishness" in the context of social media?

We could start with the term's suffix: *ish*. In popular usage, the term "-ish" suggests an **approximation** to something rather than precise definition. "Let's meet at six-ish" means that we'll meet **around** 18:00 hours but not necessarily exactly at that time. But it's quite common in everyday conversation these days  to use the ending "-ish" on its own, detached from a preceding noun, as a kind of shorthand to refer to an approximate state or emotion: "So did you enjoy the movie?" ---"Ish".

To be book**ish**, then, suggests a looser, more casual affiliation with books compared to that of the professional critic, academic literature scholor, publisher, bookseller, or author. It invokes amateur appreciation rather than scholarly expertise, pleasure rather than literary analysis. Yet because of the high cultural prestige attached to books (what Pierre Bourdieu calls symbolic capital) that remains attached to books, to identify as "bookish" is still to claim a certain form of social **distinction**. In the social media realm, then, "bookishness" becomes a form of non-specialized (at least in the academic sense of specialization) social identity, defined not by disciplinary expertise (textual analysis, historical knowledge) but by an **affective** relation to its object, often referred to as a **passion** for books and reading. From this standpoint, bookishness is a form of **fandom**, and we know how the popular knowledge of fans involves a primarily **passionate**---that is, affective---relation to its object rather than the **dis**passionate, detached stance required  of the literary scholar.

As a social (media) identity, however, bookishness involves not only an affective relation to its object but also a commodified one, that of a **consumer**. In this context, it's unsurprising that the most popular media  format of Booktubers and Booktok creators is the **recommendation video**, with recommendation here involving not just the question of whether a book is worth your time but also your money. As José Miguel Tomasena explains in his article, Booktubers on YouTube and other platforms play a crucial role in the circulation and promotion of books and authors, similar to that of music or film critics, in a similar way to how fashion or beauty bloggers become "brand ambassadors". In addition to their overtly promotional role, though, Booktubers also embody the fantasy of bookishness through **conspicuous consumption** (a term coined by Thorstein Veblen more than a century ago), essentially their fetishization of books as material objects and their elaborately  stylized performances of bibliophilia (the love of books). In her analysis of this phenomenon, Bronwyn Radden refers to it as "a bookish **aesthetic**," and this aestheticization of books and the practice of reading itself into a public ritual invokes the sociological concept of **lifestyle**, a form of modern social identity in which the modern self is articulated exclusively through commodities and consumption.

Bookishness, then, can be defined as what in social media today is known as an **aesthetic**. If we consider it in this way, we can see that there are two quite distinct modes of thinking about Booktok. The first is the approach taken by Maddox and Gill in their article, where it is contextualized as one of the many "sides" of TikTok; the other way of thinking about Booktok, which to my mind makes more sense than its "internal" relationship to other "sides" of TikTok, is to re-frame it as an aesthetic not confined to TikTok but extending across other platforms (notably YouTube, Instagram, Twitter), as well as personal blogs. While the bookish aesthetic takes different forms on each of these different platforms according to their particular affordances (YouTube vs. Insta vs. TikTok), they do have much in common. I do think it makes more sense to consider bookishness as an **internet aesthetic** and to consider it comparatively across multiple social media platforms. This is even though there are numerous articles specifically about Booktok in particular, I thought it was important also to consider the bookish aesthetic not just on TikTok but also on YouTube (the Tomasena article) and Instagram (the Redden article).

My argument here may seem a bit odd given that we are so used to thinking about social media vertically, in terms of **platform infrastructures**. Even though different platforms may have the same corporate owner, we still tend to approarch social media in this way (see the TikTok Research Network). Methodologically, it makes sense, I suppose, but the drawback is that it may lead us to miss the bigger picture; the concept of aesthetics enables us to connect the pieces of the larger jigsaw puzzle.

There is a lot more to say about the larger cult of print books and embodied reading as a backlash against the domination of digital, virtual, and visual culture. I think it would be simplistic to reduce it simply to nostalgia for analog culture, though, since we must remember that the the bookish aesthetic or subculture is itself a **networked public** (boyd) or **digital imagined community** (Anderson).
