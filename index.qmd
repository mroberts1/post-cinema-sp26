## Overview

Before Netflix, before Film TikTok, before AI movies, what was "Cinema," and what is left of it today? This course explores the many afterlives of cinema in what has been called the post-cinematic age, when the twentieth-century cultural dominance of film and television has been displaced by video games, social media platforms, and today's algorithmic technologies. Contrary to the endless proclamations of its demise, the course suggests, cinema today is proving to be surprisingly resilient in the face of the rapid technological and social transformations of the twenty-first century. Challenging the concept of the post-cinematic, the course focuses not only on the continuing development of film production and distribution infrastructures around the globe but also the persistence of the cinematic as as a global cultural form and aesthetic, from Marvel's cinematic universe to cinematic VR and now cinematic AI. As Hollywood and other film industries worldwide scramble yet again to adjust to the arrival of another disruptive technology, the course suggests that far from heralding the end of cinema, AI may turn out to have been the beginning of a new chapter in its long and turbulent history.

## Format

This is primarily a critical-thinking course, although it includes a practical and production component. This means that it encourages you to think reflexively and analytically about the digitally-mediated cultural practices that the course considers, as well as to participate in them; for example, you will be invited to experiment with image-synthesis and text-generating software and analyze the results using key concepts and theoretical frameworks.

<!-- ## Outcomes -->

<!-- By the end of the course, students will: -->

<!-- -   have acquired a deeper understanding of the social, cultural, and political dimensions of digital technologies and networked communication; -->
<!-- -   be able to apply critical thinking to contemporary developments in digital culture using relevant analytical concepts and both qualitative and quantitative methodologies such as cultural analytics; -->
<!-- -   understand basic principles of algorithmic image synthesis on a variety of platforms; -->
<!-- -   have reflected upon and discussed the larger significance of machine learning systems within global networked societies. -->

## Course Requirements

1.  Regular attendance of and preparation for class. Absences will negatively affect your final grade. Active participation will help improve your final grade. Readings should be completed by the date listed on the syllabus.

2.  Short written or video responses to reading and viewing assignments each week. Questions or prompts will be suggested in class the previous week. Please be prepared to present your text or video response in class.

You are allowed no more than one missing assignment; late assignments (i.e. assignments received after class and up to 7 days afterwards) will count as half-complete (i.e., you are allowed no more than two late assignments).

3.  Presentation (2) (20-30 minutes) of readings and relevant materials, followed by moderation of discussion. Your presentation should summarize readings, highlight particularly interesting or controversial aspects, and connect them to other relevant materials (texts, films, videos, artworks, etc.) and contexts, as well as formulating questions that will help focus class discussion. Your task is essentially to frame and guide our discussion of the readings, and to insert them into our larger ongoing discussion.

4.  Research paper or creative project

Research Paper

Write an 8-10 page (approx. 2,000-2,500 words) paper, including bibliography, on a topic of your choice relevant to the course. You will be expected to locate and read relevant source materials and use them as the basis of your paper. Try to identify a research question and/or hypothesis that the paper will explore.

Creative Project

As an alternative to a research paper, you may submit a creative project. If so, the project must be accompanied by statement on and/or documentation of 4-5 pages in length (1,000-1,250 words) that provides a conceptual overview of the project and contextualizes it in relation to the larger field of generative media practices.

## Assignments & Evaluation

-   Weekly assignments (10) (25%)
-   In-class presentation/discussion moderation (2 x 15% = 30%)
-   Gaussian splat project (20%)
