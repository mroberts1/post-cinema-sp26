Are you ``bookish''? As you'll have seen if you've read Jessica Maddox
and Fiona Gill's article about Booktok, the term has become ubiquitous
in the intersecting worlds of Booktube, Bookstagram, and Booktok, as
well as social reading sites like
\href{https://www.goodreads.com/}{Goodreads}. I want to spend some time
here reflecting on the concept of \textbf{bookishness} itself. What does
it mean to be, or to become, ``bookish''? While the term itself long
predates social media, it's taken on a particular resonance in relation
to the representation of books and the practice of reading on social
media. In that context, to be ``bookish'' means to participate in what
Maddox and Gill refer to as the ``digital imagined community'' of
bibliophiles extending across the platforms of YouTube, Instagram, and
TikTok. So what does being ``bookish'' actually mean in \emph{that}
specific context? What exactly is ``bookishness'' in the context of
social media?

We could start with the term's suffix: \emph{ish}. In popular usage, the
term ``-ish'' suggests an \textbf{approximation} to something rather
than precise definition. ``Let's meet at six-ish'' means that we'll meet
\textbf{around} 18:00 hours but not necessarily exactly at that time.
But it's quite common in everyday conversation these days to use the
ending ``-ish'' on its own, detached from a preceding noun, as a kind of
shorthand to refer to an approximate state or emotion: ``So did you
enjoy the movie?'' ---``Ish''.

To be book\textbf{ish}, then, suggests a looser, more casual affiliation
with books compared to that of the professional critic, academic
literature scholor, publisher, bookseller, or author. It invokes amateur
appreciation rather than scholarly expertise, pleasure rather than
literary analysis. Yet because of the high cultural prestige attached to
books (what Pierre Bourdieu calls symbolic capital) that remains
attached to books, to identify as ``bookish'' is still to claim a
certain form of social \textbf{distinction}. In the social media realm,
then, ``bookishness'' becomes a form of non-specialized (at least in the
academic sense of specialization) social identity, defined not by
disciplinary expertise (textual analysis, historical knowledge) but by
an \textbf{affective} relation to its object, often referred to as a
\textbf{passion} for books and reading. From this standpoint,
bookishness is a form of \textbf{fandom}, and we know how the popular
knowledge of fans involves a primarily \textbf{passionate}---that is,
affective---relation to its object rather than the
\textbf{dis}passionate, detached stance required of the literary
scholar.

As a social (media) identity, however, bookishness involves not only an
affective relation to its object but also a commodified one, that of a
\textbf{consumer}. In this context, it's unsurprising that the most
popular media format of Booktubers and Booktok creators is the
\textbf{recommendation video}, with recommendation here involving not
just the question of whether a book is worth your time but also your
money. As José Miguel Tomasena explains in his article, Booktubers on
YouTube and other platforms play a crucial role in the circulation and
promotion of books and authors, similar to that of music or film
critics, in a similar way to how fashion or beauty bloggers become
``brand ambassadors''. In addition to their overtly promotional role,
though, Booktubers also embody the fantasy of bookishness through
\textbf{conspicuous consumption} (a term coined by Thorstein Veblen more
than a century ago), essentially their fetishization of books as
material objects and their elaborately stylized performances of
bibliophilia (the love of books). In her analysis of this phenomenon,
Bronwyn Radden refers to it as ``a bookish \textbf{aesthetic},'' and
this aestheticization of books and the practice of reading itself into a
public ritual invokes the sociological concept of \textbf{lifestyle}, a
form of modern social identity in which the modern self is articulated
exclusively through commodities and consumption.

Bookishness, then, can be defined as what in social media today is known
as an \textbf{aesthetic}. If we consider it in this way, we can see that
there are two quite distinct modes of thinking about Booktok. The first
is the approach taken by Maddox and Gill in their article, where it is
contextualized as one of the many ``sides'' of TikTok; the other way of
thinking about Booktok, which to my mind makes more sense than its
``internal'' relationship to other ``sides'' of TikTok, is to re-frame
it as an aesthetic not confined to TikTok but extending across other
platforms (notably YouTube, Instagram, Twitter), as well as personal
blogs. While the bookish aesthetic takes different forms on each of
these different platforms according to their particular affordances
(YouTube vs.~Insta vs.~TikTok), they do have much in common. I do think
it makes more sense to consider bookishness as an \textbf{internet
aesthetic} and to consider it comparatively across multiple social media
platforms. This is even though there are numerous articles specifically
about Booktok in particular, I thought it was important also to consider
the bookish aesthetic not just on TikTok but also on YouTube (the
Tomasena article) and Instagram (the Redden article).

My argument here may seem a bit odd given that we are so used to
thinking about social media vertically, in terms of \textbf{platform
infrastructures}. Even though different platforms may have the same
corporate owner, we still tend to approarch social media in this way
(see the TikTok Research Network). Methodologically, it makes sense, I
suppose, but the drawback is that it may lead us to miss the bigger
picture; the concept of aesthetics enables us to connect the pieces of
the larger jigsaw puzzle.

There is a lot more to say about the larger cult of print books and
embodied reading as a backlash against the domination of digital,
virtual, and visual culture. I think it would be simplistic to reduce it
simply to nostalgia for analog culture, though, since we must remember
that the the bookish aesthetic or subculture is itself a
\textbf{networked public} (boyd) or \textbf{digital imagined community}
(Anderson).
